### Additional Stuff

The project makes use of the [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api) that has some restrictions on number of requests. Consider that if some action is abused in a short span of time an error can be returned by the API.

During the development of the project I have used the [Django import / export](https://django-import-export.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library to load data from files. It  has been included in the `requirements.txt` file.
