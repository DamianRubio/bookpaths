# Book Paths

Book Paths is a knowledge platform where users can share what they think might be a bookpath to master some subject. Its usage is recommended for people that has a learning approach based on reading.

A bookpath is a series of ordered steps through reading material that will guide a person to master a subject it is interested in.

## Functionalities

**Profile**: Registered users have a profile from where they can see the bookpaths that they are following and contribute to the platform with new bookpaths for the predefined categories. The profile works as a control panel and not as a social network profile as users are not allowed to see other peoples profiles.

### Additional Stuff

The project makes use of the [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api) that has some restrictions on number of requests. Consider that if some action is abused in a short span of time an error can be returned by the API.

The project makes use of the Python library [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to deal with the book covers. This library has been included in the `requirements.txt` file.

During the development of the project I have used the [Django import / export](https://django-import-export.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library to load data from files. It  has been included in the `requirements.txt` file.
